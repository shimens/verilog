Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net U_CPUCore/U_DP/U_PC/IDR_reg[3]_i_4_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_CPUCore/U_DP/U_PC/IDR_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell U_CPUCore/U_DP/U_PC/IDR_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
